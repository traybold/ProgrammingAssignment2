# Functions makeCacheMatrix() and cacheSolve() work together
# to store a matrix and its inverse, so that it must be
# solved only once.
#
# makeCacheMatrix() returns a list of accessor functions
# that store and retrieve a matrix and its inverse.
# cacheSolve() uses those functions to calculate and cache
# the matrix's inverse to avoid repeating the calculation.



# makeCacheMatrix() takes a matrix and returns a list of 4
# functions that update or retrieve the matrix or its
# inverse.  The functions act on 2 slots, one for the matrix
# and the other for its inverse.
#
# set() stores a value in the matrix slot and sets the
# inverse slot to NULL
#
# get() returns the matrix slot's current value.
#
# setInverse() stores a value in the inverse slot.
#
# getInverse() returns the inverse slot's current value,
# which is NULL until setInverse() stores a value there.

# cacheSolve() takes a container created by
# makeCacheMatrix() and returns the inverse of the matrix

# NULL, then the inverse is calculated and stored in that
# slot.  Otherwise, the inverse slot's current value is
# returned.
